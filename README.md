# Haskell Samples

Some samples of Haskell for the beginner that aren't about math, or incredibly
intimidating.

## How To

You'll need to download the [Haskell
Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/), install it on your system. Then
you'll have access to most of what you need to play with Haskell.

Once installed, try running the first program:

    runghc 01_not_so_bad.hs

You should see that it is, indeed, not so bad to get into Haskell.

## Why?

For the average programmer, Haskell might seem like a giant ivory tower of a
language. In reality, it does the same kinds of things that Python, Ruby, or
Java do, but in a slightly different way. So I thought I would introduce Haskell
as a plain old language, doing ordinary things, and only later build up to the
part where it's a super amazing death ray of awesome.
