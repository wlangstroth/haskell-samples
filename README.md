# Haskell Samples

Some samples of Haskell for the beginner that aren't about math, or incredibly intimidating.

## How To

You'll need to download the [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/), install it
on your system. Then you'll have access to most of what you need to play with Haskell.

Once installed, try running the first program:

    runghc 01_not_so_bad.hs

You should see that it is, indeed, not so bad to get into Haskell.
